1. Consider the CNF generated from graph 1 with k = 3 colors (graph1 3.cnf). Is this SAT instance satisfiable?

No


2. Consider the CNF generated from graph 1 with k = 4 colors (graph1 4.cnf). Is this SAT instance satisfiable?

Yes


3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring assignment) to the graph coloring problem of graph 1 based on the results of RSAT? If you can, please specify the color assignment.

This means that the graph cannot be colored using 3 colors but can be colored using 4 colors. Based on these results, it is possible to color graph 1 using 4 colors as seen below

Node 1: Color 1
Node 2: Color 2
Node 3: Color 3
Node 4: Color 2
Node 5: Color 1
Node 6: Color 4
Node 7: Color 3
Colors used:
Color 1: Nodes 1, 5
Color 2: Nodes 2, 4
Color 3: Nodes 3, 7
Color 4: Node 6


4. Use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring problem of graph 2 in graph2.txt. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph? You donâ€™t need to specify the color

8
